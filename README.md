# Leetcode

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, find two distinct indices in the array such that the numbers at those indices add up to the target. Return the indices as an array [index1, index2]. You may assume that each input has exactly one solution, and you cannot use the same element twice. The order of the indices does not matter.
